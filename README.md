# Network Course - custom http node server (without http lib ! :O)

This is the product of a one day student work about building networks from scratch.

  - There is only one server.js file
  - It uses built-in `net` lib in order to use sockets
  - It uses `fs` lib in order to read local `html` files

# Install !
    
  - Make sure you have `node` installed
  - Clone the project
  - Give it a `npm install`
  
# Install !
### Basics
  - Add more html files if you want to access custom pages
  - Run the server with `node server`
  - Open a browser and look for your custom path. He should look like this : 
    ```
    [host]:[port]/[html]
    ```
  - You should also be able to open the same page in a browser from another computer of the same network, provided you are still hosting on `0.0.0.0`.


### You can also
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF
